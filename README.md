# remark-lint-write-good

This rule for [remark-lint][] uses [write-good][] to check the content of a
Markdown file for stylistic issues:

```
{
    "plugins": [
        "remark-preset-lint-recommended",
        ["remark-lint-write-good", ["warn", {
            "passive": false
        ]]
    ]
}
```

You can apply all the checks that are listed in the write-good documentation.
In this example, for instance, the passive-voice check is disabled.
